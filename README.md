## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Senior ML Research Engineer at Qualcomm AI. ðŸ”­   
I am currently working on LLM efficiency and Agentic AI. ðŸ’¬

I previously worked on: 
 - LLM sparsity and cache efficiency: [Efficient LLM Inference using Dynamic Input Pruning and Cache-Aware Masking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01380) (*MLSys 2025*)
 - Machine Learning for GNSS localisation: [Neural Augmented Kalman Filters for Road Network assisted GNSS positioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00654) (*ICML 2025 workshop*), [GNSS Positioning using Cost Function Regulated Multilateration and Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18630) (*ION GNSS+ 2023*)
 - Personalization and test-time adaptation of Face anti-spoofing models: [Online Adaptive Personalization for Face Anti-spoofing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9897641/) (*ICIP 2022*), [A Personalized Benchmark for Face Anti-spoofing](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022W/MAP-A/papers/Belli_A_Personalized_Benchmark_for_Face_Anti-Spoofing_WACVW_2022_paper.pdf) (*WACV 2022 workshop*)
 - Image-to-Graph Generative models: [Image-Conditioned Graph Generation for Road Network Extraction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.14388.pdf) (*NeurIPS 2019 workshop*)
 - Generative vision models for medical imaging: [Adding Object Detection Skills to Visual Dialogue Agents](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-11018-5_17) (*ECCV 2018 workshop*)
 - Object detection in visual question answering: [Chest X-ray Inpainting with Deep Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.01471.pdf) (*2018 arXiv preprint*)

The repositories in this GitHub profile are 6+ years old, covering research and coursework projects from my MSc and BSc, so they are not representative of the quality of the code I write these days.
